# Band Name Generator  

A fun beginner-friendly Python program that helps you generate a band name by combining the city you grew up in with the name of your pet.  

### How It Works  
1. The program welcomes you and asks for the city you grew up in.  
2. Then it asks for the name of your pet.  
3. Finally, it suggests a possible band name by combining both answers.  

### Example  
```
welcome to the band name generator  
which did you grow up in?  
> Delhi  
what is the name of your pet?  
> Bruno  
your band name could be Delhi Bruno  
```
