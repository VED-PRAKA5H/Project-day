# Encrypt Decrypt (Caesar Cipher)

A Python program to encrypt and decrypt messages using the classic Caesar cipher technique by shifting letters in the alphabet.

### How It Works  
1. The program asks if you want to "encode" (encrypt) or "decode" (decrypt) a message.  
2. You enter the message text and the shift/key number to use.  
3. The program shifts the letters in the message forward or backward by the specified amount, preserving non-alphabet characters.  
4. It displays the resulting encoded or decoded message.  
5. You can repeat the process as many times as you like.

### Example  
```
Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:  
>encode  
Type your message:  
>hello world  
Type the shift/key number:  
>3  
the encoded text of hello world is: khoor zruog  
Want to restart this program? Type yes or no.  
>no  
goodbye  
```

### How to Use  
- Run the script using Python:  
```
python main.py
```
- Follow the prompts to input your direction, message, and shift key.

### Requirements  
- Python 3.x
