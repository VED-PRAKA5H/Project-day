# Password Generator  

A Python program that creates strong, unique passwords combining letters, numbers, and symbols based on user input.  

### How It Works  
1. The program welcomes the user and asks how many letters, symbols, and numbers they want in their password.  
2. It generates a password by randomly selecting characters from each category.  
3. The password characters are then shuffled to ensure randomness.  
4. Finally, it displays the generated password.  

### Example  
```
Welcome to the PyPassword Generator!  
How many letters would you like in your password?  
> 4  
How many symbols would you like?  
> 2  
How many numbers would you like?  
> 3  
Your password is: fG7!a9$Bm  
```

### How to Use  
- Run the script using Python:  
```
python main.py
```
- Enter your preferred password composition when prompted.

### Requirements  
- Python 3.x
