# Simple Calculator  

A Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) interactively.  

### How It Works  
1. The user inputs the first number.  
2. The user selects an operation from +, -, *, or /.  
3. The user inputs the second number.  
4. The program calculates and displays the result.  
5. The user can continue calculating with the current result or start a new calculation or exit.  

### Example Usage  
```
What is the first number?  
> 10  
chose an operation:  
+  
enter the second number?  
> 5  
10 + 5 = 15  
type y for calculating with 15 or Type for exit or Type n for calculate with new no.:  
> y  
chose an operation:  
*  
enter the second number?  
> 2  
15 * 2 = 30  
type y for calculating with 30 or Type for exit or Type n for calculate with new no.:  
> e  
```

### How to Use  
- Run the script using Python:  
```
python main.py
```
- Follow prompts to perform calculations.

### Requirements
