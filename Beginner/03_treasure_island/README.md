# Treasure Island  

A text-based adventure game built with Python where players navigate choices to find hidden treasure or encounter game-ending scenarios.  

### How It Works  
1. The player starts at a crossroads and chooses to go "left" or "right".  
2. Depending on the choice, the story progresses to a lake where the player can "wait" for a boat or "swim" across.  
3. Upon reaching the island, the player selects a door color-red, blue, or yellow-with each choice leading to different outcomes.  
4. The ultimate goal is to find the treasure behind the correct door.  

### Example Gameplay
