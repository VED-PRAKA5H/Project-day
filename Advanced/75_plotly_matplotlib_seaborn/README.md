## Project Overview

This repository demonstrates a complete exploratory analysis of the Nobel Prize dataset, tackling questions like:

- Which countries and organizations have produced the most laureates?
- How do prize categories differ in terms of winners?
- What are trends in laureate age, prize sharing, and discovery locations?
- How have patterns shifted over time?

Interactive visualizations (bar charts, choropleth maps, sunburst charts, box plots, regression plots) bring these insights to life.

## Features

- Missing value detection and handling
- Data type conversions for robust analysis
- Rolling averages to smooth time series data
- Donut, bar, and stacked bar charts (Plotly)
- Choropleth maps for geographic visualizations
- Sunburst charts showing hierarchical organization-country-city relationships
- Age analysis of laureates, including descriptive statistics
- Seaborn histograms and box plots for distribution analysis
- Regression and trend analysis with Seabornâ€™s `regplot` and `lmplot`

---

## Data Science Techniques

- Pandas aggregation: `.groupby()`, `.value_counts()`, `.merge()`, `.agg()`, `.sort_values()`
- Visualization: Plotly (`bar`, `donut`, `choropleth`, `sunburst`), Seaborn (`histplot`, `boxplot`, `regplot`, `lmplot`)
- Handling and interpreting NaN values
- Feature engineering (winning age, prize share, etc.)
- Comparative and segmented analysis across countries, categories, and organizations

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

2. Install required dependencies (recommended: use a virtual environment):

    ```
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly
    ```

---

## Usage

1. Download or obtain the Nobel Prize dataset (e.g., as a CSV file).
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook.
3. Open `EDA.ipynb` (or the main notebook for this project).
4. Follow and run the cells to reproduce the entire analysis, view visualizations, and experiment with additional questions.

---

## Notebooks

- `EDA.ipynb`: Main notebook containing all sections:
    - Data cleaning and exploration
    - Country, city, and organization analysis
    - Prize category and gender breakdowns
    - Time series and rolling average analysis
    - Age analysis, regression, and box plots
    - Interactive visualizations and insights

---

## Data

- **Dataset:** (Provide details, e.g. source URL, CSV filename, preprocessing steps if any)
    - For best results, ensure fields include birth and organization location information, ISO country codes, category, prize share, birth date, year, sex, etc.
